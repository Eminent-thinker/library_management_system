Overall, this program provides a basic framework for library management system. However, there are several areas that could be improved or expanded depending on the specific requirements of a real-world library system. For instance, error handling, data validation, and more advanced features like due dates, reservation systems, and user authentication could be added to enhance the functionality and robustness of the program.
